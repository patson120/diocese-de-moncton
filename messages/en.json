        "paragraph_1": " It was with the founding of Acadia, with the arrival of the first Acadian settlers in 1604, that Christianity began to take root in this small part of North America. In fact, history tells us that a Catholic priest and a Protestant pastor accompanied the first expedition led by Sieurs De Monts and Champlain. \nInitially, the Maritimes fell under the jurisdiction of the French episcopate in religious matters, but in 1658 Rome created an apostolic vicariate with its seat in Quebec City and jurisdiction over all French possessions in North America. Monsignor François de Montmorency-Laval was its first titular. With the rapid development of New France, the apostolic vicariate became the Diocese of Quebec in 1674. Thus, the Maritimes, which included Acadia, were under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Quebec until 1817. It was from the Diocese of Quebec that missionaries were appointed to the Maritimes and all matters relating to religious affairs were handled. In 1685, Bishop de Saint-Vallier, vicar general and bishop designated to succeed Bishop de Laval, made the first episcopal visit to the Maritimes. After the cession of the Maritimes to England in 1763, settlers of British origin arrived, mostly Irish and Scottish. The Catholic Church in the Maritimes then took on a multicultural character.",
        "paragraph_2": "In 1817, Rome decided to create the Apostolic Vicariate of Halifax, headed by a missionary of Irish origin, Bishop Edmund Burke. Two years later, in 1819, the Vatican created the suffragan diocese of Charlottetown, whose territory extended to both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Father Angus McEachern, of Scottish origin, became its titular bishop. However, since he was a “suffragan” bishop, this meant that he was subordinate to another diocese, in this case the Diocese of Quebec, for certain administrative and religious matters.",
        "paragraph_3": "In 1829, another turning point occurred when the Diocese of Charlottetown ceased to be a suffragan of Quebec and became an autonomous diocese in its own right. Subsequently, in 1842, New Brunswick was removed from the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Charlottetown. The Holy See in Rome decided to create the Diocese of New Brunswick, with its episcopal see in Fredericton, which was chosen by Father William Dollard, of Irish origin, who became its first bishop. However, in 1853, the episcopal see changed address and was transferred to Saint John, under the name of the Diocese of Saint John. During the 1830s and 1840s, French-speaking priests working in the Maritimes had put forward the idea that it would be a good thing for one of their own to be appointed to one of the episcopal sees in the region. It is said that in 1842, thirteen priests from New Brunswick met in Chatham to suggest the name of the most worthy among them to be bishop of the Diocese of New Brunswick. Two names emerged from the vote with an equal number of votes: Father Antoine Gagnon and Father William Dollard. The chair of the meeting cast the deciding vote in favor of Bishop Dollard. In 1860, Rome created a second bishopric for New Brunswick, that of Chatham, whose territory covered a large part of the east and all of the north of the province. Bishop James Rogers, also of Irish origin, became its first incumbent.",
        "paragraph_4": "It was in the 1880s and 1890s that various ecclesiastical authorities began to show interest in appointing a bishop of Acadian origin and even creating a diocese with a majority of French-speaking Catholics. In fact, several representations were made in the Maritimes, in Ottawa, and even at the Vatican. It is important to understand that since the 1860s, Acadians had been working to establish “national” institutions. These included newspapers, colleges, representative institutions (the Société Nationale des Acadiens, founded in 1881), and even symbols such as a national holiday (August 15), a flag, a national anthem (Ave Marie Stella), and a motto: “Unity is strength.” It was against this backdrop that the episcopal question was hotly debated among the Acadians. It was largely in response to this legitimate request from the Acadians that Pope Pius X appointed Father Édouard LeBlanc to the episcopal see of Saint John in 1912. Monsignor LeBlanc thus became the first bishop of Acadian origin in the Maritimes. In addition, in 1920, Rome appointed another priest of Acadian origin, Bishop Patrice-Alexandre Chiasson, as bishop of Chatham. The Diocese of Chatham had a majority of French-speaking faithful within its territory, which greatly helped the cause of this appointment.",
        "paragraph_5": " These appointments were all it took for Bishops LeBlanc (Saint John) and Chiasson (Chatham) to make recommendations to the higher religious authorities in favor of creating a diocese in Moncton. Their argument was based mainly on the steady growth of the Catholic population in the Diocese of Saint John compared to that of Protestants.  Furthermore, the bishops argued that the creation of an archdiocese in Moncton would increase the prestige and influence of Catholics in government circles and also promote a better school system, given that the Church plays a very important role in education. Interestingly, the two Acadian bishops made no reference to the language issue as such. On February 18, 1935, Bishop Édouard LeBlanc died in Saint John, and in January 1936, Bishop O'Donnell of Halifax also passed away. The circumstances were ripe for Rome to reorganize the diocesan structure of the Church. On March 18, 1936, the Vatican announced the creation of the Archdiocese of Moncton and, at the same time,  the appointment of Bishop Patrice Bray, an Eudist priest of Irish origin, as bishop of Saint John. n   On Sunday, August 30, 1936, Bishop P.A. Bray came to Moncton to read the papal decree creating the new ecclesiastical province of New Brunswick and the new archdiocese of Moncton. On December 1 of the same year, Rome informed Bishop Arthur Melanson, of Acadian origin, that he would be the first archbishop of Moncton. The ceremony to install the new archbishop took place in Moncton on February 22, 1937, in the basement of the Church of the Assumption, in the presence of fifteen archbishops and bishops, more than two hundred priests, and a huge crowd. In 1986, the anniversary of his golden jubilee, the Archdiocese of Moncton comprised 50 Catholic parishes under the leadership of Archbishop Donat Chiasson, then the third Archbishop of Moncton.",
        "paragraph_6": "6.1 Decree establishing the new diocese The new Archdiocese of Moncton was established by a decree issued in Rome on February 22, 1936, by the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. This decree was proclaimed in the Church of the Assumption in Moncton on the evening of Sunday, August 30, 1936, by Bishop P.A. Bray of Saint John, New Brunswick, who had been appointed official delegate for the occasion by Archbishop Cassulo, titular archbishop of Leontopolis in Augustania and Apostolic Delegate to Canada. Cassulo, titular archbishop of Leontopolis in Augustania and Apostolic Delegate to Canada.   By this decree, a portion of territory was detached from the dioceses of Chatham and Saint John in New Brunswick to be awarded to the new archdiocese. Thus, the civil counties of Kent for the Diocese of Chatham and the civil counties of Albert and Westmorland for the Diocese of Saint John were detached in favor of the creation of the Archdiocese of Moncton. n  6.2 Decree establishing the new ecclesiastical province\n   At the same time, another decree, also from Rome, was proclaimed during the ceremony, but this time for the creation of a new ecclesiastical province. The decree was read during the official ceremony in the Cathedral of the Assumption by Bishop Albert Leménager.   Since the ecclesiastical province of Halifax comprised three civil provinces and was considered too large, it was deemed appropriate to reorganize the ecclesiastical hierarchy of this region.   Thus, the dioceses of Chatham and Saint John were removed from the ecclesiastical province of Halifax and transferred to the new ecclesiastical province of Moncton, which is now constituted as the Archdiocese of Moncton. It was with the proclamation of these two decrees of great importance that the new Archdiocese of Moncton came into being.",
        "paragraph_7": "Source: “Les blasons” by Robert Pichette (2019)\nThe coat of arms of the archdiocese was created (in 1937) by Brother Gérard Brassard.  The official heraldic description—known as the blazon—of the archdiocese's coat of arms that follows is that given by Brother Brassard himself: \nAzure, with the Gothic initials M.A. in gold, accompanied at the top by a six-pointed silver star and a silver crescent moon at the bottom; and silver with an antique vessel in sable with a double cross and two other smaller crosses of the same color, with a gules flag, the sails argent charged with two gules keys in saltire, seven oars or emerging from the ship and plunging into a stormy sea azure moving from the base, sinister at the top a dove proper, nimbed or and radiant, descending in bar. Motto: Ut videntes Jesum. The shield is placed on the archiepiscopal cross with double crossbars. Brassard added an episcopal crozier on the left (dexter) and a miter on the right (sinister). Below the shield are “two palm branches,” whose symbolism, if any, is not explained. The whole is surmounted by the green archiepiscopal hat with ten green tassels on each side of the shield. Since Vatican II, the Church's heraldic regulations have been simplified and radically modified so that miters and croziers are no longer permitted. NOTE: A modern adaptation of the coat of arms was produced in October 2024 by Archbishop Guy Desrochers of Moncton, in accordance with the new heraldic standards.",

        "list_element_4": "The “ancient vessel,” meaning the ship or galley, is borrowed from the coat of arms of the province of New Brunswick, of which it is the main symbol.",
        "list_element_5": "The top of the main mast is a double cross to symbolize the metropolitan see of New Brunswick, while the two smaller double cross masts end in a cross to symbolize the two suffragan dioceses at the time, Saint John, created between 1852 and 1854, formerly the Diocese of New Brunswick (1842), and the Diocese of Chatham, established in 1860 and transferred to Bathurst in 1938.",

        "list_element_9": "The motto Ut videntes jesum can be translated into English as “As if we saw Jesus.” Bishop Donat Chiasson (1930-2003), third Archbishop of Moncton, gave the following explanation in the summer of 1986: “It can mean: ‘Let us walk together in faith—as if we were seeing Jesus.’ It can also mean: ‘Live as true witnesses, for when we look at you, it is as if we were seeing Jesus.’”",
        "paragraph_last": "It should be noted that the symbolism of the three masts became obsolete with the creation of a fourth diocese, that of Edmundston, established on December 16, 1944."
